    <h1>MUA: Who We Are</h1> 
    <p>Our story starts with twin sisters who were after elegant, simple pieces they couldn’t find elsewhere. Born in a small Russian town, Irina and Marina Golomazdina asked their seamstress mother to create designs for them when they were younger.</p>
    <p>Every month, we create a selection of highly-curated pieces in limited quantities. We believe in designs that can be easily matched with the rest of your wardrobe.</p>
    <p>We produce about half of our garments in Russia and the rest, across factories in Turkey, China, Belarus and other countries. Most of our partners in APAC work in compliance with global standards (WRAP, Sedex, BSCI), assuring safe, legal and ethical manufacturing processes as well as sustainable production practices.</p>
    <p>“People would always ask where our clothes came from, and we couldn’t really answer. Created by seamstresses based on our sketches, the clothes were a brainchild of many things that inspired us. Then, one day, we had an idea of starting our own brand — and it immediately felt like an obvious decision.”</p>
    <p>MUA was born in 2014, with ten items, an account on social media, and a small showroom in Russia’s Yekaterinburg. Today, we have a passionate community of women who appreciate our designs, over 30 stores and a team of 600 people that tell our story.</p>
